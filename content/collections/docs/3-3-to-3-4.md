## Overview

First read through this guide to see if there's anything that you might need to adjust. When upgrading, Statamic may automate some things for you. They'll be noted below.

In your `composer.json`, change the `statamic/cms` requirement:

```json
"statamic/cms": "3.4.*"
```

Then run:

``` shell
composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies
```

## High impact changes

## Medium impact changes

## Low impact changes

### Slugs no longer include extra characters

In some forms, the slug will get automatically generated. e.g. When you type into the `title` field on a publish form.

In 3.3, some special characters would get converted. e.g. The `&` would become `and`.

In 3.4, **these characters will not get converted**.

To enable these character conversions, you can enable a new setting in `config/statamic/system.php`.

```php
'ascii_replace_extra_symbols' => true,
```
